    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani in India doesn't just mean biryani. There are variations across the length and breadth of the country.
        There is Hyderabadi biryani (which is what I'm sharing today) where the biryani has a lot of gravy or masala and
        is cooked slowly with rice in a sealed pot. Then there is the Muslim wedding biryani which actually has lesser
        masala, but packed with flavour mostly from whole spices; the Kerala biryani, donne biryani from Karnataka and
        so many more.</p>

            <h3>Fried Onions and Basmati Rice</h3>
            <p>Fried onions are a key ingredient here, and it’s important to get this right. Onions are cut into slices
                and then
                browned on medium flame in oil. They don't need to be extra crispy, but onions should be a deep golden
                brown
                without getting burnt. You can also use store bought fried onions which are easily available in
                supermarkets
                these days. </p>
            <p>While choosing rice for the biryani, make sure to buy 'basmati rice' and not long grain rice. While they
                may look
                similar at first, good quality basmati rice is fragrant, and has grains that are thin and long as
                opposed to
                long grain rice which has fatter grains and almost no fragrance. The basmati rice is cooked for exactly
                5
                minutes in boiling water with whole spices and salt to get it to the right doneness - which is 70%.
                Drain the
                rice well to get rid of any excess water. The rice will continue to steam when we finally cook it along
                with the
                chicken and that's where it picks all the flavour and perfume from the chicken, saffron, mint leaves and
                coriander.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Chicken Marination</h3>
            <p>This Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani gets a lot of its flavor from the marinade. We are using yogurt as a
                tenderiser,
                fried onions (birista), tomato puree, red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala
                and salt
                to flavor the chicken. It's important to marinate the chicken in a large bowl for at least two hours or
                overnight for the maximum flavor. Like I said before, I prefer using only chicken thighs and legs for
                chicken
                biryani because these are the juiciest and do not become dry while the biryani cooks.</p>

    <h2>Steps for Biryani Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Once you have your chicken marinated, rice and fried onions ready, start by cooking the marinated chicken.
            To cook the chicken, place it in the dutch oven or a large pot that you plan to use for cooking the biryani,
            and cook them for 7 minutes. There is no need to stir the chicken, only flip it once around the 4 minute
            mark.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is partially cooked, the next step is to layer it with the fried onions, mint and
            coriander. The onions add sweetness and richness while the herbs add a ton of flavor and freshness.</li>
        <li>The final step is layering with 70% cooked basmati rice. Sprinkle saffron milk and ghee on top and cover
            tightly with a lid. Originally, the pot was sealed with dough to prevent steam from escaping, but a tight
            lid works just as well. It's important to cook this on a low flame so that the heat distributes evenly and
            the bottom doesn't get burnt.</li>
        <li>And there you go! The whole thing takes approximately an hour so I call this a weekend project, but after
            you've done it once, you'll realize how easy and simple making biryani at home is! The results of your
            labour will look like this, and trust me, there is nothing like the smell of chicken biryani wafting through
            the house to get everyone to the table!</li>
