    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken originated from Northern India in 1948. Created by Kundan Lal Gujral, you may notice that Butter
        Chicken (known as murgh makhani — chicken with butter), is similar to British tikka masala. Prepared in a
        buttery gravy with the addition of cream gives the curry sauce a silky smooth rich texture. Most restaurants are
        known to add in copious amounts of butter, which as a result can leave you feeling bloated or ill from the slick
        of grease.</p>
    <p> However, we found while recipe testing that we prefer to start the sauce off in Ghee (clarified butter, or you
        can use a combination of half regular butter and half oil). Adding cream at the end of cooking provides enough
        of that richness you look for in an authentic butter chicken. Our less oily version leaves you feeling good and
        satisfied.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Half KG Chicken</li>
        <li>Garam Masala</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Chaat Masala</li>
        <li>Tumeric</li>
        <li>Red Chilli Powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, mix your yogurt marinade together.</li>
        <li>Marinate chicken for 20 minutes, or overnight if time allows. (The longer it marinates, the more tender your
            chicken will be.)</li>
        <li>Sear chicken in a skillet or pan. Keep those charred bits on the pan to make your sauce. Browned bits =
            flavour. If you have too many burnt pieces stuck to the pan, you can discard some of them if you wish.</li>
        <li>Finally, make your curry sauce in the same skillet.</li>
        <li>The trick to making a great sauce is to let the tomatoes cook off for at least 10-15 minutes, until they are
            almost dry on your pan. Additionally, you can add in a couple tablespoons of water if it dries to early.
        </li>
        <li>After that, blend until smooth and add in your cream (heavy whipping cream or thickened cream). You can use
            evaporated milk or half and half for a lower calorie option.</li>
